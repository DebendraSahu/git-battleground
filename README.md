## Welcome to the Git Battleground

This repo is your training ground. Not for production/release. Not for clean code.
This is where you **fight Git**, suffer a bit, fix your mistakes, and walk out stronger.

You will battle merge conflicts, mis-commits, lost branches, and confusion.
That's the point. Better to bleed here than on a real project.

**Goal:** build real Git muscle.

Git mastery = break things, understand why, recover, repeat.

## Training Objectives

You will learn to:

- Clone the repo
- Create and switch branches
- Add, stage, and commit changes
- Push and pull like a grown developer
- Resolve merge conflicts (you WILL face them)
- Create and review pull requests
- Merge safely
- Undo mistakes without panicking
- Rebase and squash like you mean it
- Tag releases (optional challenge)

---

## Rules of the Arena

- Never push directly to `main`
- Name branches clearly, not like `yourname_final_fix` or `temp123`
- Commit messages must explain **why**, not just **what**
- If you break something, **fix it**
- Avoid panic-googling for every tiny thing... think first

## Level-Up Exercises

1. Create a branch for your name (example: `feature/alex-intro`)
2. Add a file with your name and a fun fact
3. Commit and push the branch
4. Create a pull request
5. Someone else reviews it (real comments, not emojis)
6. Trigger a merge conflict with another
7. Solve it like a warrior, not a button-masher
8. Squash commits before final merge
9. Merge your pull request
10. Celebrate briefly, then help someone else

## Victory Condition

When you can:

- Fix a broken branch
- Reverse a bad commit
- Merge without fear
- Explain Git concepts to someone else

...you are graduate.

Until then, sharpen your keyboard. The battle continues.
